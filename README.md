# Neutrini
Analysis of the spectra of neutrinos produced in the SND@LHC experiment and estimation of expected interactions. 
The data come from root files describing the production of neutrinos in the LHC at CERN. Just sharing the code I made as part of my degree final dissertation (data not available for now).

The following tasks were performed:
- Extraction of the data describing the different flavours of neutrinos
- Analysis and visualization of their spectra
- Modelling of the interaction with the target
- Estimation of the expected interactions
